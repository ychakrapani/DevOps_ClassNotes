Linux Commands:
******************************************************************


1.	Clear the screen

$ clear 




2.	Print the working directory

$ pwd



3.	Create your own directory

$ mkdir myfiles


4.	Change the directory to myfiles

 $ cd myfiles


5.	Create an Empty file

$ touch file1


6.	To list the files in a directory

	$ ls 

         ***  $ ls -al

-rw-rw-r-- 1 ec2-user ec2-user  0 Jul 17 15:30 file1

File1 : file name
15:30 : time file was created
Jul 17: date
0  : no content in the file
ec2-user: this is the group name
ec2-user: user that created the file
rw-rw-r-- : permissions to the file

R : read
W: write
X: execute 
- : no permission
Permission of the files are given as rwx

Permissions of the file are given to 3 users

Current user ⇒rw-
Group users ⇒rw-
Other users ⇒ r - -

In the beginning if you 


•	 : that means it is a file
    d : that means it is a directory



7.	Add content to an empty file 

$ ls

$ echo “This is my first file” > file1

$ cat file1   ⇒ used to print the contents of the file



8.	Append lines in to the file using echo

$ echo “hello everyone” >> file1



9.	Use Linux editors to create a file, add content to the file and save the file

> vim editor  (all the devops tool training)

This editor comes by default in the linux OS

$ vim file2

Press enter

This command will open an editor file

Press i  ⇒ to insert any data

Enter this text as an example:

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. 
It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. 
DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile way of working

To Save the file : Press ESC key

And enter 

:wq!

And press ENTER key to complete the operation

Display contents of the file:

$ cat file2

Touch : it is a command that creates an empty file

# touch file3.txt

Echo : it is a command print any text on the command line or enter any text in the file

Cat command to create files:
*************************
Creating small files with cat it often easier than opening a text editor such as nano , Vim

To create a new file, use the cat command followed by the redirection operator (>) and the name of the file you want to create. Press Enter, type the text and once you are done, press the CRTL+D to save the file.
In the following example, we are creating a new file named file1.txt:
# cat > file1.txt
Assignment:
Suppose if a file named file1.txt is already present, Use the ‘>>’ operator to append the output to an existing file.
# cat >> file1.txt
 




10.	Make a copy of an exisitng file

# cp sourcefile newfilename

# cp file1 copiedfile

# ls

# cat copiedfile

file content will be same

	


11.	Move file form 1 directory to another

Lets move file1 from myfiles directory to tmp directory of linux OS

	Syntax: mv filename /destainationpath

# mv file1 /tmp/file1

files will be not copied but moved to new directory or location



12.	tail command

# tail file1

will print only last 10 lines of the file

or

# tail -n 5 file1 ==> print only last 5 lines of the file





13.	head command

Syntax: head filename

will print only first 10 lines of the file

# head -n 5 filename

will print only first 5 lines of the file



14.	Grep command

Used to search for characters in a file and present it to you

create a file 

# vim filenew

This is my file for devops
created by sonal for devops
sonal is teaching Linux
We are learning Linux commands for devops

Press ESC key and enter the below keys
:wq!

Execute command
# grep devops filenew  ==> give only that content of file highlighting devops

This is my file for devops
created by sonal for devops
We are learning Linux commands for devops




15.	History command


16.	What are the users in my operating system:
$  cat /etc/passwd

Create a new user in linux OS

$ useradd alice

You will get permission denial error

You will have to become a super user (root user)

How do you become a super user

*** $ sudo su -     

Now Create a new user in linux OS

$ useradd alice

alice:x:1001:1001::/home/alice:/bin/bash

Alice : user
X : no password has been set for user
1001: user id
1001: group id
/home/alice : home directory
/bin/bash: shell

Remove write permission for current user

$  chmod u-w newfile

Add executable permission to current user

$  chmod u+x newfile


Remove or Add permission for users of same group

$ chmod g+w newfile

$  chmod g-w newfile

Remove or Add permission for all other users

$ chmod a+w newfile

$  chmod a-w newfile

U → file owner
G -> group users
A -> others (everbody else)


Read ⇒ 4
Write => 2
Execute 1

U → file owner  ⇒ 6
G -> group users ⇒ 4
A -> others (everybody else) => 4

$  chmod 644 newfile



**********************************************************
More commands to practice:
Sort commad

this command will print the content of the file on the screen in a sorted manner

cat command just displays the content of the file

but sort command will print the content in sorted manner

# sort file1

# sort file2

*************************

execute 2 commands together 

use | symbol  == this is pipeing symbol

# sort file1 | less

sort file content and displayes data as pages

# sort file1 | grep sonal file2

sort the contnet of the file and give lines that have above string

example2:

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-15-184 ~]$ sort file2
created by sonal for devops
ssh -i "02dec.pem" ec2-user@ec2-3-145-61-249.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
this file for devops
we are learning linux
we will need it for devops

Example 3:===> 2 commands together
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-15-184 ~]$ sort file2 | grep devops file2
this file for devops
created by sonal for devops
we will need it for devops

example 4: execute 2 commands 

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-15-184 ~]$ sort file2 | grep devops file2 -n
4:this file for devops
5:created by sonal for devops
7:we will need it for devops

==> gives output with line number

*********************************

*********

Create a user group

what is a group ==> set of users form a group

commad to create a group

# groupadd purdue  ==> creates a new group

see the group created

# cat /etc/group  ==> shows information about all the groups, at end see you group name
right now there is no user in it

scroll up and see other groups like wheel which has user ec2-user
wheel:x:10:ec2-user

adm group which has user ec2-user


adm:x:4:ec2-user

extreme right is user and left is group name

Also note that, when we just create a user, it also creates a group with same name as user
hence you see alice and bob at the end

****************

Now add users to the created group== command ==> usermod


# usermod -G purdue alice

modify user and add alice user to group purdue

-g ==> group 

# cat /etc/group

purdue:x:1003:alice

***********************************

list all users account using the /etc/passwd file

$ cat /etc/passwd

Each line in the file has seven fields as follows. For example, consider the following line:
vnstat:x:131:137:vnstat daemon,,,:/var/lib/vnstat:/usr/sbin/nologin

Where,

vnstat – The user name or login name.
x – Encrypted password is stored in the /etc/shadow file.
131 – UID (user ID number)
137 – Primary GID (group ID number)
vnstat daemon – GECOS. It may includes user’s full name (or application name, if the account is for a program), building and room number or contact person, office telephone number, home telephone number and any other contact information.
/var/lib/vnstat – Home directory for the user.
/usr/sbin/nologin – Login shell for the user. Pathnames of valid login shells comes from the /etc/shells file.

***************************************


*********************

limit outputs using the head command and tail command as follows:
tail -5 /etc/passwd  -- show last 5 users
head -5 /etc/passwd  -- shows top 5 users


********************

To list only usernames type the following awk command:

$ awk -F':' '{ print $1}' /etc/passwd


Sample outputs:

root
daemon
bin
sys
sync
games
man
lp
